# Why does zcx require Live 12.1?

zcx is written in the Python programming language. With newer versions of Python, developers have access to more features when writing code. 

The Python environment that zcx runs in is provided by Live. With Live 12.1 came an upgrade to Python 3.11.6. This newer version of Python includes several features that are very useful for zcx, and so early in development, a decision was made to target Live 12.1 as the minimum version compatible with zcx.
