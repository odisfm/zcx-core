# Starting from a blank config

Every download of zcx comes with a [demo config](getting-started/demo-tour/index.md), a sparse configuration designed to showcase zcx's features.

You may prefer to start from an even more minimal configuration.
This is made easier with the blank config included with every zcx download.

## Locating the blank config

The blank config is located at:

`<your zcx folder>/hardware/blank_config/`

!!! warning ""
    zcx releases prior to 0.7 do not contain the blank config.
    Consider [upgrading](upgrade.md).

## Using the blank config

### Alongside your existing config

See [the lesson](using-multiple-configs.md) to learn how to use multiple configs in one zcx installation.

### Replacing your existing config

Simply delete the existing folder `<your zcx folder>/_config`, copy + paste the `blank_config` folder to the zcx folder, and rename it to `_config`.
