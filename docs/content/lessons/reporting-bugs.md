# how to report a bug 🐞

If you've found a bug, or think you've found a bug, please don't hesitate to raise an issue.

There are two good ways to do this:

## create an issue on github

If you're comfortable with Github, head over to the [zcx-core repo](https://github.com/odisfm/zcx-docs/issues) and create a new issue. We don't have any enforced format at the moment.

## create a thread on discord

Head over to [the discord](https://discord.gg/DCtbuEe8Qr) and create a new thread in `#bug-reports`.
