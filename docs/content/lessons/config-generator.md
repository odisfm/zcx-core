# Matrix section config generator

You can use this tool to generate a 'skeleton' config for a [matrix section](/tutorials/getting-started/zcx-concepts#matrix-sections), with helpful comments denoting the row and column of each item.

Enter your desired height and width for the section, and this tool will generate the appropriate yaml structure for these dimensions. Click the :material-content-copy: button in the top-right corner of the output field to copy to your clipboard, and paste into your code editor.

``` { #yaml-output }
your yaml will appear here
