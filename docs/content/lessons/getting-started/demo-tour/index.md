# Demo tour

Now that you're familiar with the most important zcx concepts, it's time to take a guided tour for the demo configuration for your hardware.

Each demo config comes with some [pages](../zcx-concepts.md#pages) and several [matrix sections](../zcx-concepts.md#matrix-sections).
You will also find several examples of the [templating system](../zcx-concepts.md#templating) as well as some [dynamic controls](../zcx-concepts.md#dynamic-controls). 

Several of the matrix sections will be blank or mostly blank, and some named controls will be left undefined.
The idea is to give you a starting point, so you can start assigning action lists to controls right away, without having to manually set up matrix sections and pages.

!!! tip 
    If you'd prefer to start with an even simpler config, check out the [blank config](../../blank-config.md) that came with your download.

## Choose your hardware

If you are on desktop, select your hardware from the navigation on the left to begin the tour.

If you are using a smaller screen, press the :material-menu: icon in the top-left of the screen to expand this section and see the articles within.
