## Navigating this site

### On desktop

The navigation menu on the left lets you move between different sections of the manual. 

The table of contents on the right lets you quickly jump between headings on the current page.

Both of these menus are "scrollable" if they are too tall to fit on screen. If your browser window is narrow, one or both sidebars will disappear. In this case you can use the :material-menu: button to navigate the site. You can also 'zoom out' your browser window to keep both menus open at smaller screen sizes.

### On mobile

The :material-menu: icon in the top-left of your screen brings up a sidebar menu which lets you navigate the manual.

### Searching

Use the :material-magnify: search bar at the top of this site to find your search term anywhere on this site.

### Light/dark theme

Use the :material-brightness-4: button at the top of this site to switch the theme between light and dark.
