# frequently asked questions

### What's all this then?

Have a look at the [about page](/), or check out [the source on GitHub](https://www.github.com/odisfm/zcx-core).

### What do I need to use zcx?

* Ableton Live 12.1 or above <sup>[why?](/lessons/why-live-12)</sup>
* ClyphX Pro
* [Supported hardware](/tutorials/getting-started/installation#get-a-distribution)
* A heart full of dreams

### Do I need to be a coder to use zcx?

No programming knowledge is necessary to configure zcx. zcx configurations **do** make extensive use of a format called [yaml](/tutorials/getting-started/reading-zcx-configurations/#yaml), but it's pretty easy to pick up.

See also: [reading zcx configurations](/tutorials/getting-started/reading-zcx-configurations/).

### What hardware is zcx available for?

[See here.](/tutorials/getting-started/installation#get-a-distribution)

### Does zcx replace ClyphX?

Nope. While technically the script will run without ClyphX, it requires ClyphX running to do anything useful, i.e. trigger actions.

### Does zcx replace X-controls and G-controls

That's up to you. zcx can be used to create a far more complex interface than is practical with native ClyphX. However, that power comes with a learning curve. Only you can decide whether this tradeoff is worth it.

**Note:** You can absolutely use X/G Controls alongside a zcx script. It is recommended that you use zcx for any matrix controllers, and native ClyphX controls for non-matrix controllers.

### Can I use zcx with a non-matrix controller?

zcx is designed for matrix-equipped controllers. You could make a port for your hardware, and just not use the matrix features. That's up to you. Remember: each zcx script requires its own control surface slot.

### Is there a Discord?
