# preferences.yaml

`preferences.yaml` allows you to customise various settings of the zcx script. 

## two levels of preferences

At the root of your zcx installation is a file `_global_preferences.yaml`.
Inside your `_config` folder, you may create the file `preferences.yaml`.

As zcx allows [per-set configs](/lessons/using-multiple-configs/), the purpose of having multiple files is to allow you to have certain preferences across all of your configs, and expand or modify those preferences per-config.
If you only use one zcx config, you may choose to use either of these files.
