# Configuration files

zcx is configured through a variety of yaml files.

If this is your first time using zcx, make sure to read through the [getting started tutorial](../../lessons/getting-started/index.md), as the articles in this section will expand on the concepts explained in that tutorial.

If you are using a smaller screen, press the :material-menu: icon in the top-right to expand this section and see the articles within.
