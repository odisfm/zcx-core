# matrix_sections.yaml

`matrix_sections.yaml` is where you define logical sections of the control matrix, which must themselves be assigned to a page in [`pages.yaml`](pages.md).
You may also define a [section template](/reference/template-reference/#section-templates) here.

For more info, see the sub-section of [zcx concepts](/tutorials/getting-started/zcx-concepts/#matrix-sections).
