# Hardware reference

zcx is available for a variety of MIDI controllers.
Apart from using the correct name for [named controls](/tutorials/getting-started/zcx-concepts/#named-controls), the process of configuring zcx is basically identical, no matter which hardware you have.

However, certain controllers may have special features, or even limitations when used with zcx.
In such cases, you can refer to the page for your hardware.
If you are using a smaller screen, press the :material-menu: icon in the top-right to expand this section and see the articles within.

If a page doesn't exist for your hardware, you can assume that no special zcx functionality exists for that hardware.
You can [check here](https://github.com/odisfm/zcx-core/milestone/2) to see all known hardware-specific issues.

If you think you've found a bug, please see [this article](/lessons/reporting-bugs) to learn how to report it.
