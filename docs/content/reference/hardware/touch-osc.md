# TouchOSC

## Limitations

- Due to [limited color support](#color-support), [session view](../../lessons/session-view.md) and the control types [track](../control/track.md) and [ring_track](../control/ring_track.md) are not supported.

## Color support

When using [the demo layout](../../lessons/getting-started/demo-tour/touch-osc.md), colors should be specified from 0 to 127, which will result in monochrome feedback from darkest to brightest.
It may be possible to create a layout with better color support, but that is beyond the scope of these docs.
Animated colors are not supported at all.
