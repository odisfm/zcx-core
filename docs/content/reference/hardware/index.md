# Hardware reference

zcx is available for a variety of MIDI controllers.
Apart from using the correct name for [named controls](../../lessons/getting-started/zcx-concepts.md#named-controls), the process of configuring zcx is basically identical, no matter which hardware you have.

However, certain controllers may have special features, or even limitations when used with zcx.
In such cases, you can refer to the page for your hardware.
If you are using a smaller screen, press the :material-menu: icon in the top-left of the screen to expand this section and see the articles within.
