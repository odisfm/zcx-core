# matrix_sections.yaml

`matrix_sections.yaml` is where you define logical sections of the control matrix, which must themselves be assigned to a page in [`pages.yaml`](pages.md) or an overlay in [`overlays.yaml`](overlays.md).
You may also define a [section template](../template.md#section-templates) here.

For more info, see the sub-section of [zcx concepts](../../lessons/getting-started/zcx-concepts.md#matrix-sections).
