# Contributing to zcx

## get started

Before getting started, you should [join the Discord](https://discord.zcxcore.com) and ping `@odis`.
This helps us to co-ordinate our efforts.

## help needed

### porting zcx to more controllers

By making a port, you can help bring zcx to more controllers (and more people).
For the most part, this involves creating the yaml specification files for your hardware, and performing tests.

### contributing to the 'core'

This is the code that is common to all zcx installations, regardless of hardware.
There are two ways to do this:

#### fixing issues

Take a look at the [issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/odisfm/zcx-core/issues) to see current issues.
You can filter by the label [good first issue](https://github.com/odisfm/zcx-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).

And of course, if you've found a new issue, don't hesitate to [report it](/lessons/reporting-bugs).

#### adding features

We are always happy to hear feature requests.
Before starting work, we strongly recommend discussing it [on Discord](https://discord.zcxcore.com) first.
