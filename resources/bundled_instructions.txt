Thanks for trying the pre-release version of zcx!

Installation instructions can be found here:

Optionally, you can install the zcx user action by dragging the contents
of the `_user_actions` folder to your existing folder (`.../Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/_user_actions`


!!! Upgrading from a previous release !!!

To upgrade an existing zcx installation:

    1. Open the folder next to this file (e.g., `_zcx_push_1`)
    2. Delete the folder `_config`
    3. Locate your old zcx folder (inside `Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts`
    4. Drag the contents of the upgraded folder into the old folder
    5. Overwrite all existing files
